## Overview

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

With some knowledge of HTML and CSS, this allows me to put those skill to use and have to replicate something without Figma designs. Working with REM and Border Radius. I used flex-box to center is on the screen.

### Continued development

I will continue to focus on not repeating code. I attempted to keep CSS to a minimum with this build so any advice is greatly appreciated.
